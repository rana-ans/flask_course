1- I'm learning FLASK myself from codemy.com on YouTube.
2- And using my own Knowledge and learning to create different html and css files in flask.
3- JS and JSON files are not mine, I copied them from various learning points on the internet.
4- Most of the data is from my learnings and some of it is my own tweaks.
